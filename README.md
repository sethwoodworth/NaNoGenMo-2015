# Terminalia
[_Terminalia_](https://github.com/sethwoodworth/NaNoGenMo-2015) is a computer generated novel,
named for an ancient Roman festival in honor of the god Terminus,
who presided over boundaries.
By collecting sentences about traveling through different kinds of doors, arches, gates, &etc;
I will generate new sentences by recombining them and stringing them into chapters.
The sentences will be from books in the public domain supplied by 
[GITenberg](http://gitenberg.org),
Project Gutenberg forked to GitHub.
