# Brainstorm

I like terminal games (nethack, dwarf fortress, hack)
I like terminal interfaces and programs (vim, vi, neovim, VIM, tmux?)
I like books (and curate a large collection on github)
I like libraries
I am currently learning ruby

## Theme ideas
What about a game that you play that generates a novel that is the story of your gameplay?
It seems difficult to make the gameplay interesting enough to do this.
But perhaps ascii maps and illustrations would make it worth while.


### Library
I have ~40k books on github.
What if you could walk around a library?
What if you are building a library?
Is there a novel to be generated about the rise and fall of a library?

### Flowchart generation of fights
Find fights in stories, parse them, ???, profit?

### Travelog
Detect sentences/paragraphs about travel
Generate journeys by stringing them together

#### Exploration
I need <method of conveyance> (to|from) <city>
